# This is an Android client about Xiaoyu

## Introduction

This is a task I'm responsible for. 

The app is to help people with old and sick family members. Doctors put the information of the patient onto this app, and the patient's son or daughter can easily get the important information by our app. The user can also use this app make video call( supported by [xiaoyusdk](https://opensdk.xylink.com/groups/xiaoyu-sdk)) with others(mainly  his or her father or mother and the doctor). 

## Function

1. A Record of the Patient's illness. 
2. A tool to get connection with others.
3. A Record of  your home information and the environment around you.
